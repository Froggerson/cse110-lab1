## Introduction
Allow me to begin by giving you a few materials to help you get familiar around these parts. 
My initial [README.md file](README.md) can be found by clicking on the text to the left <--
I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/Froggerson) that you can peruse through if you are interested in what I have been doing for the past few months. However, you will find that there has been very little activity from me on that end.
## School
As you may have guessed, I am currently a student enrolled in CSE 110. Here are some other classes that I am enrolled in:
- vis 142
- cse 200
- math 182
~~I may have gotten a few of these numbers wrong, but honestly I'm too tired to check right now.~~
Like any other student, my enthusiasm and desire to learn has been dwindling with each passing quarter! Here are the main things that I believe is causing this phenomenon:
1. lack of sleep
2. covid
3. disillusionment with the future
To combat this, I came up with a few things I can do!
- [ ] drop out
- [ ] change majors
- [ ] simply cease existing
- [x] ignore all of my problems and pretend that everything is ok! :D

That is all from me for today!
I hope you enjoyed your visit here, traveler. Please be safe during your return home!
